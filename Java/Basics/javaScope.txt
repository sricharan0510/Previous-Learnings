Scope of the variable:
class
member variables --> attributes
member functions --> actions/behaviour
prototype

1.loacal variables : Declared inside the class
  scope : local/block
  block scope is a scope of variabble that we can access that particular variable in that block only.we cannot   have a chance to access outside of a block.


2.instance variables : which changes from one thing to another ex : name age
  Scope of instance variables is inside class but out of method without a static keyword
  instance of the class only (Object of class)
  you cannot access instace variable by class name
	How to create a instance variale ?
	Ans. syntax:
		new classname();
		Instance generally will be stored in an object of the class. 
		Example:
		class cat {
			String name;
			int age;
			static String species = "Carnivore";
			}
		class demo {
			public static void main (String[] args){
				cat c1 = new cat();
				cat c2 = new cat();
				cat.species;
			}

		}
